            <p class="lead">Your privacy is very important to BSL, and BSL is committed to protecting your privacy.
                Accordingly, BSL provides this Privacy Policy so that you understand how BSL collects, uses, and,
                in certain circumstances, discloses the information that you provide and/or that is automatically
                provided to BSL as a result of your download, installation, and use of BSL’s mobile application
                (“Mobile App”) and/or BSL’s website located at www.BSL-app.com (the “Website”). This Privacy Policy
                also explains the steps that BSL has taken to secure your personal and financial information.
                Finally, this Privacy Policy explains your options regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of
                your personal and financial information. By downloading, installing, and using the Mobile App, and/or
                by visiting the Website, you accept the practices described herein and within the Mobile App EULA.
                BSL is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any third-party that may be involved
                in the Mobile App and/or the Website.</p>
            <h2>How Information is Collected:</h2>
            <p class="lead">You acknowledge that when you download, install, and/or use the Mobile App, or when you
                visit the Website, BSL may use automatic means (including, for example, cookies and web beacons) to
                collect, receive, store, process, transmit, and use information about you, your Mobile Device, and
                about your use of the Mobile App and/or Website. You also may be required to provide certain
                information about yourself as a condition to downloading, installing, and/or using the Mobile App or
                certain of its features or functionality, and the Mobile App may provide you with opportunities to
                share information about yourself with others. All information BSL collects through or in connection
                with this Mobile App or Website is subject to this Privacy Policy. By downloading, installing, using,

                to all actions taken by BSL with respect to your information in compliance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="lead">BSL collects, receives, stores, processes, transmits, and uses information from and about
                you in several different ways via its Mobile App and/or its Website:</p>

                    account routing number, and other necessary bank account information, including, but not limited to

                    are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Account user name and password.
                    You agree to monitor your Account and notify BSL immediately if you believe that an Account user
                    name and/or password have been compromised, or if you suspect unauthorized payments are occurring
                    through your Account.

                    Federal, State, and/or local laws, rules, or regulations, or to display to you certain available
                    charitable raffles within a particular geographical area, based on your search request. BSL will

                cookies, web beacons, social media features and widgets, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, or any other
                tracking technologies used by third-parties. BSL is not responsible for the policies and practices of

                procedures are reasonable and adequate. While BSL believes that it uses industry-standard precautions
